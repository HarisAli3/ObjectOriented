Polymorphism:
  Compile-Time:
    * Early Binding
    * Static Polymorphism:
        1 - Method Overloading
        2 - Operator Overloading
  Run-Time:
    * Late Binding
    * Dynamic Polymorphism
        1 - Function Overriding
        2 - Virtual Function
          -> Pure Virtual Function
            -> Abstract Class
